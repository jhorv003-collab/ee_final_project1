Predicting the Modulus of Elasticity(MOE) in Wood Samples using Near-Infrared Spectroscopy and Machine Learning.
The goal of the project is to estimate the Modulus of elasticity (MOE) of wood staples using Near-Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy data. Traditional MOE measurement methods require destructive testing, making them expensive and time-consuming. NIR spectroscopy is a non-destructive, rapid, and low-cost technique. Therefore, the primary objective of this project is to investigate whether NIR data can accurately replicate the conventional mechanical testing process for determining the MOE. The dataset includes 2018 samples, each measured across 692 wavelengths. The final column represents the experimentally measured MOE. The objective is to build machine learning and neural network regression models that can accurately predict MOE values from these spectral measurements. 
We achieve this by splitting the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. Feature scaling will be applied to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model. The study will be divided into two main phases.
